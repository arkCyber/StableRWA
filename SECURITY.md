## Reporting a Vulnerability

The StableRWA team takes security vulnerabilities seriously. We appreciate your efforts to responsibly disclose your findings and will make every effort to acknowledge your contributions.

### How to Report

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by emailing **security@stablerwa.com**.

Include the following information in your report:
- Type of issue (e.g., buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
- Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
- The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
- Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
- Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
- Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

### What to Expect

After submitting a vulnerability report, you can expect:

1. **Acknowledgment**: We will acknowledge receipt of your vulnerability report within 48 hours.

2. **Initial Assessment**: We will provide an initial assessment of the vulnerability within 5 business days, including:
   - Confirmation of the vulnerability
   - Severity assessment
   - Estimated timeline for resolution

3. **Regular Updates**: We will provide regular updates on our progress, at least every 7 days.

4. **Resolution**: We aim to resolve critical vulnerabilities within 30 days and other vulnerabilities within 90 days.

5. **Disclosure**: We will work with you to determine an appropriate disclosure timeline that allows us to fix the issue while keeping users safe.

### Vulnerability Severity Guidelines

We use the following severity levels:

#### Critical
- Remote code execution
- SQL injection leading to data breach
- Authentication bypass
- Privilege escalation to admin

#### High
- Cross-site scripting (XSS) with significant impact
- Local file inclusion/directory traversal
- Sensitive data exposure
- Denial of service affecting core functionality

#### Medium
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Information disclosure
- Business logic flaws
- Insecure direct object references

#### Low
- Missing security headers
- Verbose error messages
- Minor information disclosure
- Rate limiting issues

## Security Measures
