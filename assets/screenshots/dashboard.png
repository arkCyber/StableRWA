# Dashboard Screenshot Placeholder

This file serves as a placeholder for the StableRWA dashboard screenshot.

To add the actual screenshot:
1. Take a screenshot of the dashboard interface
2. Save it as `dashboard.png` in this directory
3. The screenshot should show the main dashboard with:
   - Asset overview metrics
   - Performance charts
   - Quick actions panel
   - Navigation sidebar
   - Real-time data displays

The screenshot should be in PNG format with dimensions approximately 1920x1080 for best display quality.
