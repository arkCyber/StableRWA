# StableRWA Platform Security Policy

## Overview

This document outlines the comprehensive security policy for the StableRWA Platform, an enterprise-grade Real World Asset (RWA) tokenization framework built in Rust.

## Security Principles

### 1. Defense in Depth
- Multiple layers of security controls
- Fail-safe defaults
- Principle of least privilege
- Zero-trust architecture

### 2. Data Protection
- Encryption at rest and in transit
- Data classification and handling
- Privacy by design
- GDPR compliance

### 3. Access Control
- Multi-factor authentication (MFA)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Attribute-based access control (ABAC)
- Regular access reviews

## Security Architecture

### 1. Network Security
- TLS 1.3 for all communications
- Network segmentation
- Firewall rules and monitoring
- DDoS protection

### 2. Application Security
- Secure coding practices
- Input validation and sanitization
- Output encoding
- SQL injection prevention
- XSS protection

### 3. Infrastructure Security
- Container security scanning
- Kubernetes security policies
- Infrastructure as Code (IaC)
- Immutable infrastructure

## Cryptographic Standards

### 1. Encryption Algorithms
- **Symmetric**: AES-256-GCM
- **Asymmetric**: RSA-4096, ECDSA P-384
- **Hashing**: SHA-256, SHA-3
- **Key Derivation**: PBKDF2, Argon2id

### 2. Key Management
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Key rotation policies
- Secure key storage
- Key escrow procedures

### 3. Digital Signatures
- ECDSA for blockchain transactions
- RSA-PSS for document signing
- Ed25519 for high-performance scenarios

## Authentication and Authorization

### 1. Authentication Methods
- JWT tokens with short expiration
- OAuth 2.0 / OpenID Connect
- SAML 2.0 for enterprise SSO
- Hardware tokens (FIDO2/WebAuthn)

### 2. Authorization Framework
- Fine-grained permissions
- Resource-based access control
- Dynamic policy evaluation
- Audit logging

## Blockchain Security

### 1. Smart Contract Security
- Formal verification
- Static analysis
- Dynamic testing
- Third-party audits

### 2. Transaction Security
- Multi-signature wallets
- Time-locked transactions
- Gas optimization
- Front-running protection

### 3. Private Key Management
- Hardware wallet integration
- Threshold signatures
- Key sharding
- Secure enclaves

## Data Security

### 1. Data Classification
- **Public**: Marketing materials, documentation
- **Internal**: Business processes, configurations
- **Confidential**: Customer data, financial records
- **Restricted**: Cryptographic keys, audit logs

### 2. Data Handling
- Encryption requirements by classification
- Data retention policies
- Secure deletion procedures
- Cross-border transfer controls

### 3. Database Security
- Transparent Data Encryption (TDE)
- Column-level encryption
- Database activity monitoring
- Backup encryption

## Monitoring and Incident Response

### 1. Security Monitoring
- SIEM integration
- Real-time threat detection
- Behavioral analytics
- Compliance monitoring

### 2. Incident Response
- 24/7 security operations center
- Incident classification
- Response procedures
- Post-incident analysis

### 3. Vulnerability Management
- Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing

- PCI DSS
- GDPR
- ISO 27001

### 2. Security Governance
- Security steering committee
- Risk assessment procedures
- Security metrics and KPIs
- Third-party risk management

## Development Security

### 1. Secure Development Lifecycle
- Threat modeling
- Security requirements
- Secure code review
- Security testing

### 2. DevSecOps Integration
- Security in CI/CD pipelines
- Automated security testing
- Container scanning
- Infrastructure scanning

### 3. Dependency Management
- Software composition analysis
- License compliance
- Vulnerability tracking
- Supply chain security

## Business Continuity

### 1. Disaster Recovery
- Recovery time objectives (RTO)
- Recovery point objectives (RPO)
- Backup and restore procedures
- Geographic redundancy

### 2. High Availability
- Load balancing
- Failover mechanisms
- Health monitoring
- Capacity planning

## Training and Awareness
